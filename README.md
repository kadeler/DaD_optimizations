# Description

* [Config by sammilucia](https://pastebin.com/wXdLRqpY) - best one that've worked out for me, with minimum changes in quality and maximum performance (link is for 10xx GPU's, for 20xx+ check the sammilucia folder)
* [Config by scarface89](https://pastebin.com/4zgu18nv) - the performance is good, but kinda broken(see "Current issues" on reddit post)
* [Config by kenshinakh](https://pastebin.com/SPMR11cr) - didn't try it yet but it should work. there are multiple variants to this config so check the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TowerofFantasy/comments/wpaozv/ue4_engine_tweaks_guide_to_improving_graphics_and/) but dont forget to edit them properly, just copying wont work
* [Config by Ucogi](https://pastebin.com/GKEfiYXH) - personally the weakest improvement i've had (average 40-50 fps), but it did help a little
