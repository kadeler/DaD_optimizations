## Path for GameUserSettings.ini
C:\Users\\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\DungeonCrawler\Saved\Config\Windows\GameUserSettings.ini

## Description

* [Config by kadeler](https://pastebin.com/Q0vJ5Ld4) - pretty much the sammilucia config except most stuff removed and two quality options for 10xx added: complete potato and default settings. Make sure to enable TemporalAA when using this, config has improvements for this AA
* [Config by sammilucia](https://pastebin.com/wXdLRqpY) - best one that've worked out for me, with minimum changes in quality and maximum performance (link is for 10xx GPU's, for 20xx+ check the sammilucia folder. The 20xx+ should have better quality, but no one tested yet)
* [Config by stabface89](https://pastebin.com/4zgu18nv) - the performance is good
* [Config by kenshinakh](https://pastebin.com/SPMR11cr) - didn't try it yet but it should work. there are multiple variants to this config so check the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TowerofFantasy/comments/wpaozv/ue4_engine_tweaks_guide_to_improving_graphics_and/) but dont forget to edit them properly, just copying wont work
* [Config by Ucogi](https://pastebin.com/GKEfiYXH) - personally the weakest improvement i've had (average 40-50 fps), but it did help a little
